  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: 8 september 2025</em></p>

  <p> kunal operates mobile applications published under our developer account on the Google Play Store.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Our applications <strong>do not collect, store, or share any personal information</strong> such as name, email address, phone number, or location data. Some apps may use third-party services (e.g., Google AdMob for ads) which may collect anonymous usage information for the purpose of showing relevant advertisements.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>If our apps include ads, we may use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> or similar advertising networks. These third parties may collect data such as device type, coarse location, and general app usage in order to deliver better ads.</p>
  <p>For more details, please review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Googleâ€™s Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our apps are intended for a general audience and do not knowingly collect data from children under the age of 13.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>Since our apps do not collect or store personal information, there are no risks of data breaches from us. Any data handled by third-party services is managed under their own policies.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted at the same link provided in the Play Store listing.</p>
